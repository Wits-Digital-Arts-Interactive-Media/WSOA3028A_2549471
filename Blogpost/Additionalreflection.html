            <h2>Fixing JavaScript Issues and Enhancing Functionality</h1>
        </header>

        <section>
            <h2>Troubleshooting JavaScript Issues</h2>
            <p>Throughout the development of my website, I encountered several problems with JavaScript functionality. Common issues included errors due to improper variable scoping, unexpected behavior in animations, and misalignment of interactive elements. To address these, I thoroughly debugged my code, used browser developer tools to identify and fix errors, and ensured I followed best practices in coding. For instance, I transitioned from using the <code>var</code> keyword to <code>let</code> and <code>const</code> to avoid scoping issues, as advised by my lecturer.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Advanced JavaScript Implementations</h2>
            <p>To enhance the user experience, I introduced a "cartoon box" interaction for my folder panel. This feature allowed the folder panel to exhibit animated behavior, such as opening and closing with a cartoonish bounce effect, making the interaction more engaging and visually appealing. This was implemented using JavaScript's DOM manipulation and CSS animations.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Learning from YouTube Tutorials</h2>
            <p>To expand my knowledge and skills, I relied on YouTube tutorials from channels like "Traversy Media" and "The Net Ninja." These channels provided step-by-step guides on various topics, including incorporating web fonts and advanced CSS techniques. Specifically, I followed tutorials on using Google Fonts and other web fonts, which helped me integrate stylish typography into my website, enhancing its visual appeal.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>Blog Navigation and Enter Website Flicker</h2>
            <p>I attempted to create a blog navigation menu using JavaScript. While it worked as intended, I realized it was redundant since my main navigation already provided sufficient access to all sections of the website. As a result, I decided to streamline my navigation structure to avoid clutter.</p>
            <p>Additionally, I implemented an "Enter Website" flicker effect, where the entry point to my website would flicker dynamically when accessed. This effect added an interactive and eye-catching element, although it worked correctly only on a live server. This limitation highlighted the importance of testing and deploying features in their intended environment to ensure they function as expected.</p>

            <h2>Implementing CSS with a Consistent Theme</h2>

            <article>
                <h3>Cartoonish Pixel Art Theme</h3>
                <p>Inspired by my clothing brand Rushbite, I adopted a cartoonish pixel art theme for my website. This theme not only reflects my brandâ€™s aesthetic but also adds a playful and unique character to my digital presence. The use of pixel art elements provided a retro feel, appealing to a niche audience who appreciates vintage and creative designs.</p>

                <h3>Structuring CSS for Different Sections</h3>
                <p>To maintain organization and ensure consistency, I created separate CSS files for different sections of my website:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Blog Pages:</strong> The CSS for my blog pages was tailored to enhance readability and provide a clean, structured layout for my posts. I used a simple yet effective design that complemented the pixel art theme without distracting from the content.</li>
                    <li><strong>Design Pages:</strong> For the design pages, I focused on showcasing my wireframes and design process. The CSS emphasized clarity and visual appeal, with animations and hover effects to make the interaction more engaging.</li>
                    <li><strong>Home Page:</strong> The home page CSS included the animated welcome text and interactive elements that greeted visitors with a dynamic and inviting experience.</li>
                    <li><strong>Profile Page:</strong> The profile page CSS was designed to highlight my personal and professional information, using a consistent color scheme and typography to align with the overall theme.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Despite having multiple CSS files, I ensured consistency by using a common color palette, typography, and design elements across all sections. This approach helped maintain a unified look and feel, providing a seamless user experience.</p>

            <h2>Reflections on Code</h2>

            <article>
                <h3>Benefits and Challenges of Responsive Design</h3>
                <p>Responsive design is crucial for ensuring my website is accessible and functional across various devices and screen sizes. The benefits include a wider reach, improved user experience, and enhanced SEO performance. However, the challenges involve extensive testing and optimizing performance across different devices, which can be time-consuming and technically demanding.</p>

                <h3>Decolonialism in Coding Practices</h3>
                <p>When thinking about how our code matters in terms of decolonialism, it is essential to be aware of biases that may be inadvertently embedded in the design and functionality of digital content. This includes ensuring that my website does not privilege certain user groups over others and actively works to include diverse perspectives and needs. Reflecting on the VAP methodology, I can strive to create a website that promotes values such as equality, inclusion, and respect for cultural diversity, aligning with decolonial principles.</p>
            </article>

            <p>In conclusion, the process of developing my website has been both challenging and rewarding. By integrating JavaScript and CSS effectively, I have created a dynamic and visually appealing website that aligns with my brand and values. The experience has also underscored the importance of inclusive and decolonial practices in digital design, ensuring that my work contributes positively to a diverse and equitable online community.</p>
