            <h2>What changes have you had to make to your website to incorporate JavaScript?</h2>
            <p>Incorporating JavaScript into my HTML website has brought a dynamic and interactive layer that greatly enhances user experience. Here are the key changes I made:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Animated Welcome Text:</strong> On my homepage, I replaced the static "Welcome" text with an animated version using JavaScript DOM manipulation. This code changes the inner text of the H1 element to display a welcoming message that animates when the page loads, giving a more engaging first impression.</li>
                <li><strong>Navigation Menu:</strong> I created a comprehensive navigation menu using JavaScript. This menu includes hyperlinks to all the sections of my website, such as Essays, Design, and Portfolio. This makes it easier for users to navigate without having to press the back button multiple times.</li>
                <li><strong>Scroll to Top Buttons:</strong> To improve usability, I added "Scroll to Top" buttons on each page. These buttons use JavaScript to smoothly scroll the user back to the top of the page, where the navigation menu is located. This ensures that users can quickly return to the main navigation menu and access other sections of the site without hassle.</li>
                <li><strong>Blog Post Menu and Wireframe Iterations:</strong> I also created a dedicated menu for all my blog posts and wireframe iterations. Using JavaScript, this menu dynamically updates to include new blog posts and wireframes as they are added. This makes it easy for users to find and access my content in a structured manner.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>How does that help me streamline my interaction design?</h2>
            <p>These changes have significantly streamlined my interaction design in several ways:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Enhanced User Engagement:</strong> The animated welcome text captures the user's attention immediately upon landing on the homepage. This sets a lively tone for the rest of the website and encourages users to explore further.</li>
                <li><strong>Improved Navigation:</strong> The comprehensive navigation menu simplifies the user journey across the website. By providing direct links to all major sections, users can easily find the content they are interested in without having to navigate through multiple pages.</li>
                <li><strong>Efficient Access:</strong> The "Scroll to Top" buttons ensure that users can quickly return to the navigation menu, enhancing the overall ease of use. This is particularly useful for longer pages where scrolling back up can be tedious.</li>
                <li><strong>Organised Content:</strong> The blog post and wireframe iteration menus organize my content in a user-friendly manner. Users can easily locate specific blog posts or view the progression of my wireframes, making the website more informative and structured.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Incorporating JavaScript has transformed my website from a static collection of pages into a dynamic and interactive experience. The changes have not only improved the usability but also made the website feel more cohesive and professional. By focusing on the informational and navigational components, I have ensured that my website is both easy to use and engaging for my audience. This process has highlighted the importance of interactive design in creating a positive user experience, a key takeaway from my interactive media class.</p>

            <h2>Decolonizing Digital Spaces: A Reflection</h2>
        </header>
        
        <section>
            <p>Decolonizing is a term that traditionally refers to the process of a state withdrawing from a former colony, allowing it to achieve independence. In contemporary contexts, it extends to the dismantling of colonial ideologies and practices in various domains, including education, culture, and technology. Decolonizing aims to address and rectify the lingering impacts of colonialism, fostering autonomy, cultural reclamation, and equitable power dynamics. This reading on "Algorithmic Colonisation of Africa" by Abeba Birhane is particularly resonant for me as a South African digital arts student because it delves into the modern iteration of colonialism through technology and algorithms. This piece highlights the intersection of technology and colonialism, illustrating how Western technological monopolies perpetuate control and exploitation in the Global South.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Why I Chose This Reading</h2>
            <p>I chose this 21-page reading because it speaks directly to the experiences and challenges faced by many African countries, including my own. As a South African digital arts student, I am keenly aware of how digital platforms and algorithms influence our daily lives, culture, and even our creative expressions. This article provides a critical perspective on how these influences often stem from Western-centric viewpoints that do not consider the unique contexts and needs of African societies.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Analysis of the Article</h2>
            <p>One of the strengths of Birhane’s article is its thorough examination of how Western-developed technologies, particularly AI, are ill-suited for African problems and contexts. The concept of "algorithmic colonialism" is compelling and well-articulated. Birhane draws parallels between traditional colonialism and modern technological practices, illustrating how both seek to dominate and exploit. The article emphasizes that while traditional colonialism was driven by political and governmental forces, algorithmic colonialism is driven by corporate interests. This is a crucial point, as it highlights the shift from overt political control to subtler, yet equally pervasive, corporate dominance.</p>

            <p>Birhane effectively uses examples to illustrate her points. For instance, she discusses Facebook’s project to create a population density map of Africa using satellite imagery and AI. This project, framed as a humanitarian effort, echoes colonial rhetoric of knowing what is best for the colonised and acting without their input or consent. This example underscores the insidious nature of algorithmic colonialism, where technology companies impose their solutions without considering local knowledge or needs.</p>

            <p>However, the article also has its weaknesses. One potential shortcoming is its focus on the negative aspects of Western technological influence without sufficiently exploring possible solutions or alternative models of technology development in Africa. While Birhane does mention the potential benefits of AI when developed and implemented with local contexts in mind, the article could benefit from more detailed discussions on how African countries can build their technological capacities and infrastructures to resist algorithmic colonialism.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Reflection and Application</h2>
            <p>In class, we have covered various theories that relate to the ideas presented in Birhane’s article. One such theory is critical media studies, which analyses the power structures and ideologies embedded in media and technology. This theory helps to unpack how digital platforms and algorithms can reinforce existing inequalities and biases. Birhane’s article highlights how Western-developed AI often reflects and perpetuates Western values and interests, rather than addressing the needs and realities of African societies. This is a key concern in critical media studies, which advocates for more inclusive and equitable media practices.</p>

            <p>Reflecting on Birhane’s article, I am struck by the importance of context in technology development and implementation. As a digital arts student, I see firsthand how imported technologies often fail to align with our local contexts and needs. For instance, social media algorithms prioritise content that adheres to Western standards of engagement and relevance, often sidelining African voices and perspectives. This not only limits our representation but also impacts our cultural expression and identity.</p>

            <p>One way to address this issue is by fostering local technological innovation and development. Encouraging and supporting African tech startups and researchers can help create technologies that are better suited to our contexts. Additionally, there should be a greater emphasis on collaboration and knowledge exchange between African and Western technologists, ensuring that local insights and expertise are incorporated into technology design and implementation.</p>

            <p>Education also plays a crucial role in decolonizing digital spaces. As digital arts students, we need to be critically aware of the power dynamics and biases inherent in the technologies we use and create. This awareness can guide us in developing more inclusive and equitable digital practices, whether in art, media, or technology. We must challenge the dominance of Western perspectives and strive to amplify and prioritize African voices and experiences.</p>
