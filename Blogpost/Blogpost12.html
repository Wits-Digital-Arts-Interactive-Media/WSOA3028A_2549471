            <h2>Reflection on the Reading</h2>
        </header>
        
        <section>
            <h2>Defining the Reading</h2>
            <p>The reading by Flanagan and Nissenbaum titled "A Game Design Methodology to Incorporate Social Activist Themes" discusses the Values at Play (VAP) methodology. This approach integrates social values into game design, ensuring that games reflect ethical ideals and human values such as justice, equality, and cooperation. The authors argue that games, like other cultural media, inherently carry embedded beliefs and can influence social norms and behaviours. This methodology is particularly illustrated through the "RAPUNSEL" project, which aimed to teach programming to underprivileged girls while promoting gender equity and creativity.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Personal Relevance</h2>
            <p>I chose this reading because, as a South African digital arts student, I am keenly aware of the transformative potential of digital media in addressing social issues. South Africa's history and ongoing struggles with inequality and social justice make this approach highly relevant. The VAP methodology aligns with my interests in creating digital content that not only entertains but also educates and empowers marginalized communities.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Strengths and Weaknesses</h2>
            <p>One strength of the VAP methodology is its systematic approach to embedding values into game design, which can lead to more socially conscious and impactful games. However, a potential weakness is the challenge of balancing these values with other game design requirements, such as entertainment and commercial viability. Relating this to theories covered in my interactive media class, the VAP methodology reflects principles from Participatory Design and Value Sensitive Design, which emphasise user involvement and ethical considerations in the design process. Yet, implementing these values consistently can be complex and may require more extensive research and resources.</p>

            <h2>Reflection on CSS, HTML, and JS Integration</h2>
        </header>
        
        <section>
            <h2>CSS, HTML, and JS Integration</h2>
            <p>In developing my website, CSS is crucial for defining the visual style and layout, ensuring that the HTML content is presented in an aesthetically pleasing and user-friendly manner. JavaScript enhances interactivity, allowing for dynamic content updates and user engagement. The integration of these technologies aligns with the principles discussed in the reading, as it involves thoughtful design choices that reflect values such as accessibility and usability.</p>

            <p>After meticulously planning my website through the IxD process, creating wireframes, and developing a style guide, the next step is to implement these plans in the actual code. For example, if my design specifies a blue background, I will ensure this is reflected in the CSS styling. If the plan includes images that move across the screen, I will animate these using JavaScript. The HTML will be structured to replicate the layouts envisioned in the wireframes. Similarly, if I intend for elements to increase in size when hovered over, I will write the necessary JavaScript code to achieve this effect. Additionally, based on feedback from my lecturer, I will avoid using the <code>var</code> keyword in my JavaScript due to its error-prone nature related to scoping issues, and instead use <code>let</code> for better code reliability and maintainability.</p>

            <h2>Benefits and Challenges of Responsive Design</h2>
            <p>Responsive design is beneficial as it ensures that the website is accessible and functional across various devices and screen sizes, enhancing user experience and inclusivity. However, it also presents challenges, such as the need for extensive testing and potential performance issues due to varying device capabilities. The VAP methodology's emphasis on values can inform responsive design by prioritising accessibility and user experience for diverse audiences.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Colonialism in Coding Practices</h2>
            <p>In considering neocolonialism within my coding practices, it is essential to be aware of biases that may be inadvertently embedded in the design and functionality of digital content. This includes ensuring that my website does not privilege certain user groups over others and actively works to include diverse perspectives and needs. Reflecting on the VAP methodology, I can strive to create a website that promotes values such as equality, inclusion, and respect for cultural diversity, aligning with decolonial principles.</p>
