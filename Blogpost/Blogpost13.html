            <h2>What Does the Internet as an Ethical Space Mean to Me?</h2>
            <p>Reflecting on the internet as an ethical space really gets me thinking about how we interact online and how our actions affect others. As a South African digital art student who loves animation and various art media, this idea hits close to home. It’s about creating a digital world where respect, empathy, and responsibility are at the forefront of everything we do.</p>
            <p>For me, the internet as an ethical space means a place where I can share my art and animations without worrying about plagiarism or negative comments. It’s about being part of a community that values and respects creativity and diversity. An ethical internet would support artists like me, allowing us to express ourselves freely while also considering the impact of our work on others.</p>

            <h2>What Would This Look Like?</h2>
            <h3>Inclusive and Respectful Communities</h3>
            <p>In my ideal ethical internet, online communities for artists, animators, and gamers would be inclusive and supportive. We’d have platforms where everyone’s work is respected, feedback is constructive, and harassment is nonexistent. It would be a place where different cultures and artistic styles are celebrated, not ridiculed.</p>
            <h3>Responsible Content Creation and Sharing</h3>
            <p>Being responsible online means giving proper credit to creators and thinking about how our work affects others. For me, this involves making sure my animations are culturally sensitive and contribute positively to the community. It’s about creating art that’s mindful of different perspectives and experiences.</p>

            <h2>What Are the Challenges We Face?</h2>
            <h3>Anonymity and Accountability</h3>
            <p>One major challenge is the anonymity of the internet, which can lead to people behaving badly because they don’t have to face consequences. This anonymity can result in cyberbullying, trolling, and the spread of false information, making the internet a less safe space for everyone.</p>
            <h3>Digital Divide</h3>
            <p>There’s also the issue of the digital divide. Not everyone has the same access to the internet or digital literacy skills. This can create inequalities in who gets to participate and be heard online. In South Africa, and in many other places, this divide can marginalize certain voices, making it harder for everyone to benefit from the internet equally.</p>
            <h3>Intellectual Property Concerns</h3>
            <p>As an artist, protecting my work online is a constant worry. Digital art can be easily copied and shared without permission, which undermines our rights as creators. We need better systems to protect our work while still encouraging sharing and collaboration.</p>

            <h2>CSS Implementation Process</h2>
        </header>
        
        <section>
            <h2>Initial Challenges and Failures</h2>
            <p>Implementing the CSS to reflect my style guide has been a mix of successes and learning experiences. Initially, I struggled with ensuring that the typography, particularly the Canva Sans Bold for headings, appeared correctly across all devices. There were issues with the font size not scaling properly, causing the headlines to either look too large on mobile devices or too small on larger screens. Additionally, achieving the right balance with the colour palette was challenging. The primary colour, #004AAD (Royal Blue), didn’t contrast well against the black background initially, making some elements hard to read. Adjusting the shades and adding subtle shadows helped mitigate this issue.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>Ongoing Work</h2>
            <p>Currently, I am focusing on refining the grid layout to ensure consistency and visual harmony. Aligning elements and spacing them evenly has required tweaking and testing across different browsers to maintain the responsive design I aim for. I’m also enhancing the interactive elements, such as buttons and hyperlinks, by adding hover effects and animations that align with my aesthetic of vibrant sophistication. Ensuring that the high-resolution images load efficiently without compromising the site’s performance is another area I am diligently working on, using responsive images and optimizing file sizes. Overall, while there have been setbacks, each challenge has brought me closer to creating a visually stunning and immersive digital experience as envisioned in my style guide.</p>

            <h2>Feedback Issues and Initial Problems</h2>
            <p>After receiving feedback on my blog posts and HTML/JavaScript throughout my website, I identified several areas that needed improvement. Initially, I scored a 0.52 out of 1 for reflection and theory: critical reflection because I didn’t adequately consider the strengths and weaknesses of the theories and research I covered. My depth of engagement also scored 0.52 out of 1. Additionally, I scored 0 for JavaScript variables and 0.44 out of 1.5 for JavaScript events and DOM due to some non-functional buttons, although the scroll-to-top button worked. My semantic markup received a mediocre score of 0.76 out of 1.5.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>Corrected Blog Post Issues</h2>
            <p>I have successfully addressed the issues with my blog posts. Now, I focus on deeply engaging with the theories and research I discuss, making a concerted effort to highlight both the strengths and weaknesses of each theory for a balanced critical reflection. In my latest posts, I critically evaluate Silverstone's mediapolis concept by discussing its relevance and limitations in today’s digital world. This has enhanced the depth of my engagement and provided a more thorough and reflective analysis.</p>

            <h2>Ongoing HTML and JavaScript Corrections</h2>
            <p>I am actively working on correcting the issues in my HTML and JavaScript:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>JavaScript Variables:</strong> I am integrating more JavaScript variables into my code to manage dynamic content and improve functionality. For instance, I'm starting to use variables to store user input and preferences, which will enhance the interactivity of my site.</li>
                <li><strong>JavaScript Events and DOM:</strong> I am reviewing and debugging all my event listeners to ensure they function correctly. I have identified the issues with the non-functional buttons and am working on correctly binding event handlers and ensuring they manipulate the DOM as intended. My goal is to have all buttons, including those for navigation and interactive content, working seamlessly.</li>
                <li><strong>Semantic Markup:</strong> I am improving the semantic structure of my HTML by ensuring proper use of HTML5 semantic elements. I am reviewing and updating sections, articles, headers, and footers to enhance readability and accessibility, which will improve both user experience and search engine optimization.</li>
            </ul>
