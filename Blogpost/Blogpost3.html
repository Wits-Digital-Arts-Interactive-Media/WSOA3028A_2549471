      <h2>My Weekly Blog Entry - Week 3</h2>
      
      <h1>Website Updates</h1>
      <p>In my journey of web development, I've encountered various challenges and successes as I endeavor to craft an engaging online presence. Recently, I undertook significant updates to my website, refining its structure, adding fresh content, and aligning it closely with my vision.</p>

      <p>During this process, I carefully reassessed the folder structure, opting to rename certain sections to better convey their purpose. Notably, I transformed the "Contents" folder into "Portfolio" to accurately represent the showcased works and projects.</p>

      <p>Despite encountering hurdles in updating links and references, particularly with stubborn references resisting modification, I remained steadfast in enhancing the user experience. Embracing creativity, I introduced a playful element with a section titled "Crack Open," encouraging visitors to delve deeper into the content.</p>

      <p>Moreover, I expanded the homepage content to offer seamless access to the "Portfolio" section and other vital pages, strategically placing links to streamline navigation.</p>

      <p>In terms of aesthetics, I drew inspiration from early 2000s web design, aiming to evoke nostalgia while infusing it with a contemporary twist. This resonates with the preferences of my target audience, primarily Gen Z to millennials, who value self-expression and individuality.</p>

      <p>Mapping out the site's content and interface elements, I prioritized a user-centric approach. The homepage boasts bold visuals reminiscent of Y2K aesthetics, captivating visitors' attention from the outset. Each section is meticulously designed to facilitate intuitive navigation and exploration of the website's content.</p>

      <p>Prompting users to subscribe to the newsletter and integrating social media icons foster community engagement, while a streamlined checkout process ensures a seamless transaction experience.</p>

      <p>Reflecting on my development progress, I've concentrated on incorporating semantic markup to enhance website structure, accessibility, and search engine optimization. Drawing insights from various resources, I've recognized the significance of semantic HTML elements and descriptive URLs.</p>

      <p>Implementing semantic markup across various sections has enhanced structural clarity and accessibility. Additionally, refining the user interface and navigation elements has contributed to a more immersive and cohesive online experience.</p>

      <p>Looking ahead, I plan to further refine the website's design and content, integrating additional features to elevate user engagement and satisfaction.</p>

      <h2>Folder Structure</h2>
      <p>The organization of your website's folders can vary based on its purpose and individual preference. Throughout the iterative process of website development, multiple revisions may occur until an optimal structure is established. Currently, my folder arrangement is as follows:</p>

      <ul>
         <li>BlogFile (folder): This directory houses HTML files for weekly blog posts, ensuring a tidy appearance and easy access.</li>
         <li>Images: All necessary images for the website are stored here.</li>
         <li>Portfolio: HTML files related to my portfolio are housed within this directory.</li>
         <li>Scripts: JavaScript code is organized and stored here for accessibility.</li>
         <li>Style: CSS code is neatly organized in this folder.</li>
         <li>index.html (homepage): This page features a brief biography and provides links to navigate users to the desired sections of the website.</li>
      </ul>
