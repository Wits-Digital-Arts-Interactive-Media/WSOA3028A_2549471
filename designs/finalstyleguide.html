        <h2>Goal and Aesthetic</h2>
        <div class="description">
        <p><strong>Goal:</strong><br>
           My goal is to create a visually stunning and immersive digital experience that captivates visitors and reflects my passion for creativity and innovation. The website should feel like a retro arcade game, as one can tell from the pixel art, bold buttons, and bright contrasting colors. This design aims to evoke nostalgia while providing a modern and engaging online space.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Aesthetic:</strong><br>
            The aesthetic of your website is a nostalgic, retro arcade game-inspired design. The use of pixelated fonts, bold buttons, and bright, contrasting colors (such as yellow, orange, and sky blue) evokes a sense of playful nostalgia while maintaining a structured and engaging layout. This style invites users into a dynamic, game-like experience that is both visually striking and easy to navigate. The central alignment of the website name and navigation menu, along with the speech bubble-like content containers, reinforces the classic arcade game theme, creating a cohesive and immersive digital space.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Visual Design Elements</h2>

        <div class="description">
        <p><strong>Typography:</strong><br>
           <em>Headings:</em> The font style used is a pixelated, retro-inspired typeface to enhance the arcade game feel (Press Start 2P).<br>
           <em>Font Size:</em> Approximately 36px for headlines.<br>
           <em>Body Text:</em> A clean and readable pixelated font to ensure optimal legibility across various devices.<br>
           <em>Font Size:</em> Approximately 16px for body text.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Colour Palette</h2>

        <div class="side-by-side">
            

            <p class="info">This is the color palette that I have chosen for my website. I chose these colors because they are vibrant and energetic, reflecting the dynamic and playful nature of a retro arcade game.<br><br>

            <strong>Primary Color:</strong><br>
            Sky Blue (#5CB6FF): This bright, cheerful blue serves as the primary background color, creating a clean and engaging canvas for other design elements.<br><br>
            <strong>Secondary Colors:</strong><br>
            Red (#F50000): This bold red is used for buttons and important call-to-action elements to draw immediate attention.
            It is also used to coat my texts in the design pages to create that speech bubble effect.<br>
            Orange (#FF8902): A vivid orange used for highlights and interactive elements, adding a sense of energy and enthusiasm.<br>
            Yellow (#FAD54C): This sunny yellow is utilized for accents and to highlight key information, providing a warm contrast against the blue background.<br>
            Dark Grey (#07050F): A deep, nearly black grey used for text and other critical elements to ensure readability and provide a strong contrast.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

        <h2>Layout and Structure</h2>

        <div class="description">
        <p><strong>Grid Layout:</strong><br>
           Content is organized using a grid-based layout for consistency and visual harmony, ensuring that elements are aligned and spaced evenly.</p>
        

        <p><strong>Responsive Design:</strong><br>
           The website is designed to be fully responsive, adapting seamlessly to various screen sizes and devices for optimal user experience.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Interactive Elements</h2>

        <div class="description"> 
        <p><strong>Buttons:</strong><br>
           Styled with bold, blocky shapes and a high contrast border to stand out. They have a subtle shadow effect for depth and dimension.<br>
           Hover effects include color changes to indicate interactivity.</p>

        <p><strong>Hyperlinks:</strong><br>
           Styled with an underline and the primary accent color (#5CB6FF) to distinguish them from regular text and encourage click-throughs.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Text Alignment</h2>

        <div class="description"> 
        <p><strong>Website Name and Navigation Menu:</strong><br>
           I want my website name, "Billy Jean," to appear at the top middle of all my pages. Placing the website name centrally creates a balanced and prominent focal point that immediately captures the visitor's attention. Directly below the website name, the navigation menu will also be centrally aligned at the top. This ensures that users can easily access different sections of the website without any distraction.</p>

        <p><strong>Content Containers:</strong><br>
           To enhance the retro arcade game aesthetic, most of my texts will be placed within containers that resemble speech bubbles, a common feature in many video games. These speech bubble containers will have bold outlines and vibrant background colors that stand out against the page, mimicking the dialogue boxes found in classic arcade games.</p>

        <p><strong>Page-Specific Alignments:</strong><br>
           <em>Headings:</em> All page headings will be centrally aligned within their respective speech bubble containers. This alignment maintains consistency and highlights the importance of each section.<br>
           <em>Body Text:</em> The body text on all pages will be justified within their speech bubble containers. This alignment ensures a neat and professional look while fitting seamlessly within the retro game theme.</p>

        <p><strong>Example Alignment:</strong><br>
           <em>Homepage:</em> The website name "Billy Jean" is prominently displayed at the top center, with the navigation menu directly below it. The rest of the content, such as introductory text and key highlights, will be within centrally aligned speech bubble containers.<br>
           <em>Other Pages:</em> Similar to the homepage, the website name and navigation menu are centrally aligned at the top. Each section of content, including headings and body text, will be enclosed in speech bubble containers to maintain thematic consistency.</p>

        <p>By adopting this alignment and container style, my website will effectively evoke the nostalgic feel of retro arcade games while ensuring a user-friendly and visually engaging experience.</p>
