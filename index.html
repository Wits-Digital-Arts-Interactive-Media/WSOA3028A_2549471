 <h1>My WEEKLY BLOG ENTRY</h1>

 <h2>WEEK 1 </h2>

 <body>
 <p> As I reflect on my experience so far with HTML and web development, it's been a journey marked by both challenges and exciting discoveries. Enrolling in the Interactive Media course came with its share of hurdles, primarily due to amendment issues that caused a delay in my participation. However, this setback didn't deter my enthusiasm for learning and delving into the world of web design.
</p>
 <p>One aspect of this journey that stands out is my familiarity with GitHub. Having previously worked on game group projects that heavily relied on GitHub for version control and collaboration, I found it less challenging to navigate this platform compared to other aspects of web development. GitHub's interface, branching system, and collaborative features provided a sense of familiarity and ease as I embarked on creating my own website.</p>
 
<p>Central to my learning process was the act of writing notes. As I explored the different elements within HTML required to construct text on a website, I diligently recorded my observations and insights. From understanding the significance of the "title" element in defining the document's title to grasping the role of "h1" and "p" tags in structuring content, each element contributed to my growing comprehension of HTML's capabilities in shaping the visual and textual components of a webpage.</p3>

<p>Setting up GitHub and publishing to Pages was a significant milestone in my journey. The process of creating a repository, uploading files, and enabling GitHub Pages felt empowering as I witnessed my HTML document come to life on the web. This hands-on experience not only solidified my understanding of version control and web hosting but also instilled a sense of pride in showcasing my work to a wider audience.</p>

<p>In relating my experience to the readings and lectures, I've discovered a profound connection between the evolution of the internet and my own journey in web development. The foundational principles outlined in the readings resonate with the core concepts of HTML and CSS, emphasizing the importance of accessibility, usability, and user experience in designing digital interfaces.</p>

<p>Exploring the history of the web has been equally enlightening. From its humble beginnings as a means of information sharing to its transformation into a dynamic platform for communication and collaboration, the web's evolution mirrors my own aspirations for growth and innovation in the field of interactive media.</p>

<p>Looking ahead, my goals for this course extend beyond acquiring technical skills to encompass a deeper understanding of the principles and practices that underpin interactive design. I aspire to leverage my newfound knowledge to create engaging and user-centric experiences that resonate with audiences across diverse digital platforms.</p>
